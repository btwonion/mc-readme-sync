# Magnetic

> Drops and XP fly straight into your inventory (telekinesis from Hypixel Skyblock)

**Mine, chop, and fight without the cleanup.** Magnetic sends item drops and experience directly to you, so loot cannot get left in tall grass or scattered across a cave.

Inspired by the Hypixel SkyBlock Telekinesis enchantment, Magnetic feels like a natural part of survival: obtain the enchantment through normal gameplay, put it on a tool, and keep doing what you were doing.

## Features

- **Instant auto-pickup:** Collect item drops and XP without walking over them.
- **Satisfying or invisible:** Let drops fly toward you, change their speed, or disable the animation for instant pickup.
- **Vanilla-style progression:** Find Magnetic through trading, loot, or the enchantment table.
- **Flexible activation:** Require the enchantment, sneaking, a permission, or a combination of conditions.
- **Precise exclusions:** Ignore drops from selected blocks or entities using Minecraft IDs or tags.
- **Bucket-aware pickup:** Collect drops caused by fluids from a bucket you placed.
- **Full-inventory alerts:** Choose a sound, chat message, or title, each with its own cooldown.
- **Multiplayer-ready:** Use the same core behavior in singleplayer or on Fabric, NeoForge, and Paper servers.

## How it works

1. Equip a tool with the **Magnetic** enchantment.
2. Break a block or kill a mob.
3. Its drops and XP travel straight to you.

That is the default behavior. Server owners and modpack authors can also make Magnetic always active, permission-based, or active only while a player sneaks.

## Install

Download the file for your platform from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/magnetic/versions). Fabric and NeoForge builds are also available on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/magnetic-telekinesis/files). Then add the required dependencies:

| Platform | Installation | Required dependencies                                                                                                                                                   |
| --- | --- |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fabric | Put Magnetic in the `mods` folder | [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api), [Fabric Language Kotlin](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-language-kotlin), and [YACL](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl) |
| NeoForge | Put Magnetic in the `mods` folder | [KotlinLangForge](https://modrinth.com/mod/kotlin-lang-forge) and [YACL](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl)                                                                 |
| Paper | Put Magnetic in the `plugins` folder | None; players can join without installing the mod, but for the best experience the client mod is recommended                                                            |

[Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) is optional on Fabric and provides quick access to Magnetic's config screen.

## Compatibility
**Tested integrations:**

- **Fabric and NeoForge:** FallingTree, KleeSlabs, RightClickHarvest, Tree Harvester, and Veinminer
- **Paper:** mcMMO, AuraSkills, and the TreeCapitator datapack


- Grave mods on paper require "minecraft:player" to be added to the "ignoredEntities" config options

## Configuration

Magnetic works out of the box with the enchantment. For more control, edit `magnetic.json` or use the in-game config screen:

| Setting | What it controls |
| --- | --- |
| `conditionStatement.raw` | When Magnetic activates; accepts `ENCHANTMENT`, `SNEAK`, `PERMISSION`, `&&`, and `\|\|` |
| `itemsAllowed` / `expAllowed` | Whether item drops and XP are collected |
| `buckets` | Whether and for how long placed-bucket effects trigger Magnetic |
| `leafDecay` | Whether natural leaf-decay drops caused by eligible log breaks are collected |
| `ignoreBlocks` / `ignoreEntities` | Source blocks and entities to exclude by ID or tag |
| `animation` | Flight effect, speed, and whether other players can intercept items |
| `fullInventoryAlert` | Sound, message, and title alerts with separate cooldowns |

Common condition statements:

- `ENCHANTMENT` — the default
- `ENCHANTMENT || PERMISSION` — enchantment for players, permission override for staff or ranks
- `SNEAK` — active while crouching
- An empty statement — always active

Apply file changes with `/magnetic reload` (OP/level 3). The permission condition checks `magnetic.ability.use`.

See the [complete configuration reference](https://github.com/btwonion/magnetic/blob/master/docs/CONFIG.md) for every setting and its default.

## FAQ

### Where can I find the Magnetic enchantment?

Magnetic is available through the enchantment table, loot, and librarian trades. With the Villager Trade Rebalance experiment disabled, librarians from any biome can offer it. With the experiment enabled, look for a desert librarian; Magnetic is part of the desert's common enchanted-book pool.

### Does Magnetic work in multiplayer?

Yes. It supports singleplayer, modded servers, and Paper servers. Players joining a Paper server do not need to install Magnetic themselves.

### Do I have to use the enchantment?

No. Change the condition statement to make Magnetic always active or use `SNEAK` or `PERMISSION` instead.

### What happens when my inventory is full?

Drops remain safe, and Magnetic can notify you with a sound, chat message, or title.

### Can other players take items while they are flying toward me?

You decide. Set `animation.canOtherPlayersPickup` to control whether flying items can be intercepted.
